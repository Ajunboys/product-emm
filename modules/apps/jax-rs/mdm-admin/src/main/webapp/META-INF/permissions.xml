<!-- This file contains the list of permissions that are associated with URL end points
    of the web app. Each permission should contain the name, permission path ,API path
    (URL) , HTTP method and OAUTH2 authorization scope (not-required).
    When defining dynamic paths for APIs, path variables are denoted by '*' notation.
    For ex:
    Actual API endpoint: mdm-admin/devices/{device-id}
    URL to be represented here: mdm-admin/devices/*
    NOTE: All the endpoints of the web app should be available in this file. Otherwise
    it will result 403 error at the runtime.
